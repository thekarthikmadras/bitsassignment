Assignment 1 â€“ PS-5
General Instructions
1. Each group is expected to submit a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and a pdf file of the
same.
2. Each output generated should be justified.
3. No extension on the deadline
4. Submissions using other python IDEs will not be considered for grading.
Perform the following tasks using the given dataset
Dataset :
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MrOqsO6HajwraBGnvcu9NLoI63c5DvcE/view?usp=sharing
(Consider the text column that represents a review in the dataset)
1. Data Preprocessing
a) Cleaning: Remove all punctuation, numbers, and special characters from the dataset.
Eliminate commonly used stop words. (1 Mark)
b) Normalization: Apply stemming or lemmatization techniques to convert words to their base
or root forms. (1 Mark)
2. POS Tagging and Frequency Analysis
Use a POS tagging algorithm or a pretrained tagger to label each word in the dataset.
a) Compute the frequency of each POS tag throughout the dataset.
b) Identify and display the most frequently occurring POS tags along with their counts.
c) Extract and print sentences that contain selected POS tags (e.g., nouns, verbs).
(3 Marks)
3. Visualization
Generate visual representations to support your POS analysis:
a. A bar chart to display POS tag frequencies
b. A word cloud to highlight frequently used words (1 Mark)
4. HMM POS Tagging
Apply a Hidden Markov Model-based POS tagging approach to the first four rows of the dataset
and display the results. (2 Marks)
5. POS and NER Integration
a) Select a few representative sentences and annotate each word with both its POS tag and
Named Entity Recognition (NER) label.
b) Identify examples where POS and NER tags either contradict or complement one another.
Explain how this relationship can be leveraged to improve the quality of text analysis. (2 Marks)
