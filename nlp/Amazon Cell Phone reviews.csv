B0000SX2UC,Janet,3,"October 11, 2005",FALSE,"Def not best, but not worst","I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?",1
B0000SX2UC,Luke Wyatt,1,"January 7, 2004",FALSE,Text Messaging Doesn't Work,"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out.

The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range...",5

B0000SX2UC,habblie,4,"December 25, 2004",FALSE,"works great, but don't dropt it","I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.",1
B0000SX2UC,Zachary O. Toups,1,"November 29, 2004",FALSE,"Slow, annoying, fragile, heavy, and bulky...","1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.",4
B0000SX2UC,esti,2,"September 8, 2004",FALSE,Worth paying more for something else.,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",5
B0000SX2UC,brittho,4,"August 17, 2004",FALSE,Great free phone for Sprint customers.,This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,1

B0009N5L7K,L. Hughes,1,"July 21, 2005",FALSE,WARNING,"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.",

My goal was not to buy a phone that would last 4 years (I didn't expect any phone would) and certainly was not to buy a $20 phone that would last 4 years. My goal was just not to spend $150 on another phone. I hoped it might last 6 months, until I decided what to do next (change service providers, get a new contract with a free phone, etc.) To my surprise, this little brick of a phone just keeps going. It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works. Complaints: I dearly wish it had a camera, even a crappy one. Sometimes the exposed buttons get pressed accidentally. It has no fancy features. But I'm going to buy another one-- just in case this one ever quits. UPDATE 1/1/12: This phone is still going. 5+ years now. I bought this phone when the first-generation iPhone came out.

I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well. My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting.

As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on.

I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something.

B000SKTZ0S,Love Gadgets,3,"October 29, 2007",FALSE,Great disposible phone?,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.",

It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar.

The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?

It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example.

Battery life is solid. I'll give samsung credit for the rotating/changable keyboard, a cool thing for the next model might be a customizable keyboard where you have the ability to assign values to each key. As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare). I also dont plan on using it as an MP3 player...I have an ipod for that. If your looking for a phone to synch with outlook then find one where that is offered in the specs. Yes you can remotely sync and get access to web email but nowhere in the description is outlook mentioned so I cant hold that against the phone. It would be like faulting my car cause it doesnt fly (I know thats an exageration but its kinda the same thing) when its clearly not meant for that.

This is basically your standard flip with a few extra features and probly wont be as popular with the mickey mouse club kids that want an iPhone like device that they can watch movies on and giggle over the txts their friends just sent.

B0029F2O3A,M. Brennan,3,"October 13, 2010",FALSE,I like it but a few shortcomings are significant enough that I wouldn't buy it again if I lost it.,"Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It's like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it's really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I'm fully awake and alert :-) it's hard to open and I've dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there's no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock's snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you're on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn't display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said ""Hey let's meet later!"" and the person asks you ""Ok, what time is it now?"" and you can't tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don't they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren't too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it's like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to ""sync"" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they'll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can't select multiple photos at once. Won't send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn't carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like ""every other week"". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I'm off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don't; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I'll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn't too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as ""fully integrated"" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn't support accessing attachments. This is not what I call ""fully integrated"". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it's an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university's email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn't too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone's contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn't clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don't know...) Beware of Verizon's compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn't presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a ""web browsing plan"", not a ""data plan"". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my ""data plan"". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don't know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it'd be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can't. Sound on the built-in speakers is decent for something so small.",3
B0029F2O3A,D. Kashmiri,2,"September 23, 2009",FALSE,Not an upgrade over original Alias,"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity.",4
B0029F2O3A,Meg M.,4,"August 4, 2010",FALSE,Good Phone that could use a few tweaks,"I've gone through several phones in the last few years - whenever my rebates would apply I would upgrade. Last year I settled on the Alias 2, mostly because of the e-ink technology. I was impressed at first but the excitement of the new phone wore off as it always does. Regardless, it remains a trustworthy phone. Hopefully Samsung's newer versions of the Alias will fix a few flaws that I've run into, not the least of which is a slow system. When you're in the middle of typing a text and a new text comes in, the phone freezes momentarily before saving the text-in-progress in a draft and showing you the new text. The fact that the phone saves the text is good - but it would be better if the incoming text flew to the background and the phone allowed you to continue your typing. I've had to learn that when I'm typing a text and the phone stops registering what I'm trying to enter, I have to stop pushing buttons. If you give it a second, it'll resume normal running - otherwise, you might accidentally delete the incoming text. The same goes for trying to take a picture while a text comes in - except the picture doesn't save. Occasionally the phone gets confused - if you flip from landscape to vertical positions too fast, the keys and screen don't change, even after you push a few buttons. It continues to operate as if it were in vertical mode, even though the phone is flipped to the normal position. I like that I can switch from vertical to horizontal and back while in the middle of a text, but this only works if you flip fast enough (there's plenty of time - plus if you close the phone and don't flip fast enough, it simply saves your draft) and doesn't apply to any application other than an in-progress text. There's a decent signal with the Alias 2 - my previous phone was a cheap-o so I noticed an improvement in the signal but I can't verify that it's better than the enV or Omnia or other higher-end phone. If you're considering this phone, take into consideration that none of the cases, including the slimmest clear plastic ones, fit very well on the dual-hinge. They don't prevent the phone from opening, but they do cause a strain on the hinge when flipped in landscape mode and they make phone bulkier than necessary. In terms of size, it has a great feel. It's probably a little bit taller than most phones (about the size of the enV Touch and the orignal enV) but it's very slim and definitely pocket-sized. The keyboard, both in landscape and vertical modes, is a great size and perfect for texting. The keys have a unique feel and are not too big and not too small. The front display provides access to your music and taking a picture self-portrait style. (I've seen some complaints that this isn't possible - it is, you have to hold down the play/pause button then the skip-back button to activate the camera. You can see a preview of the picture and simply press the play/pause button again to take the pic.) The front display also allows you to see text message previews and a quick response with the ""Quick texts"" ... You have to have ""Auto-display text"" options set - a feature I didn't discover until I'd had the phone for six or seven months. (Probably should have read the manual!) The volume for the speaker and the mic are good - I haven't had trouble with not being able to hear anyone or with them hearing me. The speaker phone can be a bit crackly if it's up all the way, but full volume is not necessary as it is plenty loud. When the phone is closed, i.e. listening to music - it needs to be up a bit louder and therefore is sometimes crackly but I'm satifisied with it. After all, it's phone, not a iPod dock. All-in-all, this is a great phone with just a few minor problems. I'm still happy with it after the initial novelty has worn off, even though I'm lusting after an enV Touch (just my personal fickleness when it comes to phones!) I'm saving my money, however, and holding onto the trusty Alias 2.",

Also, the screen is quite pretty. I have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature. When receiving calls, the phone works over half the time, but it sometimes resets when I attempt to answer calls. Also, at other times it lights up when a call is coming in, but won't actually finish the process and start ringing, so I don't know who actually called until they tell me later. I'm beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone, and I suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up.",12

The Alias 2 allows me, a novice texter, to send and receive text messages with no real hassles. The keypad is a great size, even for my larger fingers.

I have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately. Its voice recognition software is worthless, so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial (such as in the car using an earpiece), don't bother. The camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good. The battery in this phone doesn't last near as long as my old LG, however this phone has many more features, so I think the battery life is acceptable.

The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.)

After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years.",5

I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.)

Phone call quality is ok. it has a spot for upto 16GB card, which would be perfect if it was useful as an MP3 player. If it wasn't too late to return it , I would.

There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four. It's a nice reliable little phone. If you are interested in a standard phone for texting and calling, this is great for you.

First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery. Plugged it into the supplied (with the phone) charger, and received an error message that the charger was not an authorized Motorola charger. Bought a new charger (now we;'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It's used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone's failure to even operate in basic mode. I've got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be ""refurbished"" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you're taking a big risk that it'll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned.

B002UHS0UI,George,5,"March 7, 2013",TRUE,Great option vs data plan phones,"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.",4

B002UHS0UI,farmgirl,1,"November 5, 2011",TRUE,I feel duped,"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",10

Now my review: I paid $20 for a USED Moto Razr, and it was a screaming deal! The phone is slim, still styleish after all these years and works PERFECTLY!! Razr has always been a good phone. DON'T BE STUPID and follow the negitive reviews, these are from clueless consumers who really don't know much about electronics.

B002UHS0UI,Stephen,5,"May 23, 2012",FALSE,Old Faithful,"I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service. What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.",36

Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than. Several factory resets and hours later it was stable again, but only temporarily... Pretty sure we got a lemon. It is now in the trash.

This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones.

The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning.

In addition, the screen would freeze up and go between frozen to blank white. Terrible responsiveness, show shipment, defective product.

B002UHS0UI,Roger Williams,2,"September 18, 2011",FALSE,VERIZON BUYERS BEWARE OF OLDER PHONES,"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought. Different products, exact same problem.",35

They responded immediately - shipped out new charger same day AND said I could throw the other one away. They saved me from having to do anything! No return shipping, etc. That, to me is Outstanding Customer Service! We love the phones! Perfect for people who prefer flip phone. Durable - which is good for my hunter and my 85 yr old mother! Mother likes to text some, but gets real confused with a qwerty keyboard. Texting is smooth and easy with the dial pad on this phone - works really great for her. The feature to announce who's calling helps her because some ring tones don't register with her hearing aid. The voice announce works perfect. Both users are very happy with their phones.",18

I don't ever remember submerging it, but it has been in water soaked clothing on numerous occasions. Call quality has been good. I am now starting to notice some more breakup in calls as the phone has aged, but at this point it is hard to complain. My biggest complaint is that it does not stay connected with blue tooth headsets as well as I would like. It almost needs line of sight if you are just sitting idle. I have tried a couple of different headsets with the same results. Sending text messages is a little difficult without a keyboard but that is a given. The camera is average. It is good for quick shots but I grab a regular camera for anything I intend to print out. The bottom line is that if you are looking for a basic, rugged, and durable flip phone, this is the one.",2

I figured I'd pay the extra money to get a Mil-spec phone and not have to worry about damage happening. I have a kayak and wanted to be able to take a phone out on the boat without worry about water getting in it. I also purchased a Verizon belt clip with holder that wraps around the phone. Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone. I'd have had a lot more dollars in my pocket, since the Mil spec designation adds NOTHING! Other than that it's a pretty good phone. Just don't buy it for its ruggedness.",4

It may be if you are in the military recruitment office. In the real world the first phone lasted only a little over a month before the flip section got broken off.

You can actually use the phone's USB cable feature to upload music, ringtones, and contacts but neither the manual nor tech support will tell you how. Good luck figuring it out. It was a frustrating trial and error process. You can also find third party software to load your calendar for a lot less than $50 but Motorola and Verizon techs aren't allowed to direct you. If you're on a job site that uses the PUSH to TALK function, it might be worth putting up with this phone and provider but there are better options out there - phones that are more rugged and waterproof and will actually let your use the phone's features.

But Verizon made me purchase minutes? - Fixed, great phone!","It seems like the seller(s?) don't know the difference between the prepaid version of the phone and the standard contract version. Either that or Verizon is just full of idiots (entirely possible.) When I activated the phone online, with the aid of Verizon live chat service, it made me dial a number and then required me to purchase minutes. I have read other reviewers say that Verizon would not/could not activate their phone on the prepaid network. I'm not sure what's going on but I'm pretty irritated. I like the phone, alot for the use I've gotten out of it so far (very little), but the whole reason I ditched my smartphone was because I was sick of all the complicated BS. P.S. If anyone could help me figure out what's going on here I'd appreciate it. EDIT: Apparently me and Verizon were both being idiots. I have it active and working as it should now. The phone itself is wonderful. Since I still have a data plan I can get all kinds of cute little arcade games and apps. Simple things of course but I'm a simple lady. It's a pretty sturdy phone, it's lightweight and feels like it might be made of cheap material but it's designed in a way to take a fall. One reason smartphones break so easily is because they are square and flat. This thing is rounded on any angle. The 'closed' screen is flat but it is slightly inlayed in the phone so if you do drop it directly on that surface it will hit the plastic edges of the phone and not the screen. The backplate isn't sealing as tightly as it should, which probably does not make it waterproof ""up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes"" but I think that might have been my fault by trying to improperly open the backplate. The keypad is silicone or something and has no gaps. With the backplate properly sealed I'm sure it is waterproof. Christmas came early lol I'm happy with this little guy. Oh and no more charging my phone twice a day. I haven't charged it since I got it a week ago and despite use in almost every possible way it didn't get down to one battery bar until today. It charged back to full in half an hour. It is a beautiful thing.",3

Just to solidify my dinosaur status, I keep a new back-up V860 in my office all the time, so when the one I am using breaks down (every 4-5 years), I have that back-up to activate immediately.

I thought it might have come with an old battery, so I bought a replacement battery but I still had the same problem, so I suspect the phone is just an energy hog to some degree.

It holds a charge quite well, and since it isn't one of the newer phones, I don't have to pay for a data plan. If you just need a basic phone with your Verizon cell service, this is a great choice.

Good reception.","Motorola Barrage - MOTV860 UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER: Alright, so maybe this isn't such a bad phone after all. It is VERY simple and it STILL gets great reception compared to other verizon phones I've had. I still wouldn't call it rugged at all. But, for a penny- I think it is the best bet of all the 1 cent options, as it is still working great after 6 months and the fact that it weighs nothing and doesn't seem to contain any glass or metal as advertised has become less annoying as it has been consistently performing well. No problems since the early exchange for the dud. Maybe they just need to change their advertising angle as it isn't bad at all, but is NOT industrial grade. Because of it's consistently very high talk quality and ease of use, I have upped it a star. ____________________________ UPDATE: two months later... Returned the original phone because the screen kept going blank. Had no problems at Verizon with the exchange because it had been purchased within 30 days and have had no problems with the replacement phone. The reception is still VERY good and the Battery life long. But still... it is not a rugged phone by any stretch. There is no such thing as an industrial grade phone. Please Motorola, start making something in the USA! ----------------------------- Maybe this was designed to military specs, but it is just a cheap plastic phone... toy even. I don't know where the metal and glass is on this consumer version of what may have once been an industrial grade design. The hinge doesn't seem to be metal, it seems to be plastic although it could be aluminum or some other inexpensive and light metal. The screen doesn't seem to be glass, but plastic. screen goes completely white randomly, rendering it useless a good deal of the time. Don't know that it would survive even a 2 foot drop, since it didn't seem to make it through shipping without getting messed up. The product description is a joke compared to what was actually delivered. Looking for a rugged phone? Don't look to the Barrage unless appearances are all that matters. This phone should be heavy, it weighs nothing and feels cheap. I don't know that a truly rugged phone exists anymore. If Motorola won't make a quality product in the USA, there's no one that will. The only thing positive about this phone is that it does seem to get rather good reception when the screen isn't white. If Motorola wants to tout this phone as rugged, they need to use the original design components or change the description from metal and glass to thin plastic, made in China. Bottom Line - Looks Tough, feels weak. Good Reception. Rugged? HA... All Hat, No Cattle.",14

The LED flashlight was nice, but not nicer than being able to surf the WEB surfside. So, I exchanged it for this much less glitzy Motorola Barrage. I have already used it to get my email and upload documents far from any available Wi-Fi hot spots (cool!) and it has come in handy when I am in the shower and I get an important phone call (like from my wife). It also uses the same cord as the other cell phones in the family, which is great on trips. It has some other surprisingly useful features. For example, I can make a call without looking at the phone because it pronounces the names of my contacts as I scroll through the list. Also, it is actually very useful to know who is calling without having to put down whatever I am carrying to look at the cell phone display. The voice recognition, e.g., ""Call... John... Mobile,"" actually work on this phone for me and that is a first. I already have several great digital cameras, so I always thought having a camera phone was sort of stupid. But the other day I bought something at the lumber store that didn't have a sticker. No problem, I just snapped a picture of the display tag, and the cashier keyed the SKU right in. I put one of those 4 GB micro SD cards into the phone for $11 so I can transfer files back and forth from the phone to my laptop, or to other computers. That's when one gewfy 'feature' of the phone showed up. When you first plug it in to the USB cable, you get to choose between ""Media Sync Mode"" and ""Modem Mode."" Choosing ""Media Sync"" gives you the option to either download music, or NOT. ""Not"" mode does nothing... nada... Zippo... except to charge the battery. If you want to transfer files or photos, you have to go into ""Tools"" and select ""USB Mass Storage."" But even *that* is gewfy, because there are two menu items that have the phrase 'USB'. To transfer files, you want the one that results from, ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 2. Tools, 8. USB Mass Storage,"" and *not* ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 9. USB Mode."" Pretty stinkin' ridiculous, eh? The bluetooth pairing thingie works, but I can't get used to making or answering calls on a headset. Plus, people who walk around in public talking to themselves seem icky to me. I might get a car adapter someday, and I am confident this phone will work with it. Other than that one weird menu glitch, I really, really like this phone.",61
B002WTC1NG,TinkerMan,3,"February 9, 2011",FALSE,Hit or (mostly) Miss Phone....,"My wife and I finally decided to upgrade our VZW phones but really didn't want or need ""smart"" phones. Unfortunately, most carriers have drastically reduced the number and quality of basic ""feature"" phones they carry - I suspect it's an underhanded effort to ""encourage"" customers to buy the more expensive phones and data plans. At the kiosk where we shopped - there were only 3 feature phones available and the Motorola Barrage seemed to be the pick of the litter. My Barrage has worked well since the purchase - however - I make very few calls during the day and the ones I do make are brief. On the other hand, my wife's Barrage was a disaster... she uses hers just a little more than I use mine - but is not, by any means, a cell phone junkie. Her initial charge lasted 5 days - GREAT! The next full charge lasted about 3 days - HUH? The next full charge lasted less than a day - CRAP!!! Verizon gladly offered to exchange the phone - but they were 'out of stock'. We waited several days for a replacement - only to learn that the phone was being discontinued and there would be NO new ones. A couple of these phones were finally located at a WalMart about 20 mile away - so, I made the trip and exchanged the phones. HOWEVER, her new phone was worse than the first.... the initial full charge lasted just a little over a day. I did an internet search and found this to be quite a common problem for this phone. I tried every posted ""fix"" to no avail. My wife grew tired of dealing with it and finally exchanged her Barrage for an LG Clout... which has performed flawlessly and gives her 5 days to a full charge. I'm just praying MY Barrage doesn't peter out now. Maybe I'm lucky and got a ""good"" one. Other minor complaints.... the battery cover is hard to install properly - even the Verizon agent didn't know how. If the cover is not FULLY seated, the phone WILL NOT be water resistant..... you can find this discussed on several different websites as well. Once you learn a few tricks, it becomes easier to do. The MP3 player interface is the quite dated and clunky old Verizon ""V Cast"".... it's high time Verizon reworked this dinosaur into something a little more flexible. There is no graphic equalizer - heck, there's not even a basic tone adjustment - so you'll have to live with the fairly flat audio the player has. The headphone jack is 2.5mm - unfortunately, common headphones have a 3.5mm plug and won't work without an adapter (I finally bought a pair of BlackBerry earbuds with a 2.5mm plug on Amazon for $4 and they work GREAT!!!). The Barrage is a bit thick compared to other flip phones and may be uncomfortable to hold in smaller hands. The thickness also makes finding a suitable case difficult. So - only 1 (out of 3) of these phones worked for us.... those are not great odds. I like mine so far - but I'm nervous that it won't last and I can not recommend this phone without some serious reservations. If you're seriously considering this phone (as Dirty Harry would say) you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well do ya, punk?",4

That's why I try to buy the ""ruggedized"" phones, the heavy duty ones that are supposed to be able to handle some abuse. This phone did not live up to it's billing. I even bought two separate protective cases, a leather one, and then a hard rubber one. Even with the cases on, the phone was useless after only a month and a half. First the front screen cracked. No big deal, it happens on pretty much every phone I've had. But then, the main screen went blank, and I was left with trying to dial or pull up numbers blindly from memory. After a month and a half? very disappointed. My first phone was a motorola, and I loved it, this one did not hold up. I went with a Casio GzOne Ravine 2 Verizon, instead and have been extremely happy with it. The front screen hasn't even cracked yet, and it's been over 6 months.

I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount.

After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and ""*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired."" and in a separate email, ""Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST."" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by ""We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST"". A week later, I got another message, ""Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing"", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA.

I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what.

My wants are simply, good phone service, big screen, one button speed dial, answer by opening lid and again, TOUGH ! Have had the phone two months and with an easy modification am very pleased with the phone. Read a lot of reviews and the most common complaint was the PTT feature being turned on often. Yes I found this to be a real pain, often having to press buttons to tell the phone I didn't want to enable the service. After waiting the 30 day return period I fixed that issue. Took a razor blade and carefully scrapped the case around the PTT button, then around the button. This was done to get good adhesion for step two, superglue.

I wasn't impressed with the construction when I purchased it but had to have a replacement. The Rugby II was the toughest phone stocked at the store. The included software to sync to my PC does not work, nor do any newer versions downloaded from Samsung. There is no support through Samsung for their software that I can find. The soft keys are programmable and I have made them match my old tundra. That is a real plus. I have read a lot of complaints about inability to disable PTT but I don't think it can be disabled on the tundra either. There is no option to disable the data keys. The Tundra allowed locking the browser and other data usage so there were no inadvertent connections. IM is the only lockable internet ap in the Rugby II Tundra was able to usb connect to PC for data transfer. Rugby II has to have a mini sim card installed before it will even try.

AT&T keeps trying to blame the reception issues on a local network problem. A coworker has an identical phone with the identical problem.

B/c of the false information AT&T gave me on multiple calls (5 calls!), I could not get a new, alternative brand phone. So, I was forced into The Rugby II. Well, I'm happy to say it is much more reliable than the original! I haven't had any dropped calls. I haven't had any spontaneous connecting to the internet, either. The PTT button is still in the same spot as the original, but I don't seem to hit it as often. *shrug* I have a data plan, but this is not user friendly for that purpose. It will take pretty decent pictures when it's folded. The texting bit is still a hassle, though. Predictive texting is easier, but a bit sketchy, and I haven't found a way to get rid of words from its vocabulary once they've been added. It's bulky and heavy, too, but it helps me keep up with it. If I'm suddenly feeling lighter, I know I've left my phone somewhere. LOL If you want a feather-light phone or one with all the bells and whistles, this isn't the phone you want. You'll need a heavy duty case, too. I use a magnetic one made by body glove. I haven't had any difficulty pairing the Rugby II to my mac or my phone, or my PDA for that matter (BUT it won't SYNC with the Mac or PDA b/c they're not Windows machines). I can send pics, videos, etc. with no difficulty. Also, on the previous phones, I don't know if there was a voice dial option, but it's on the II. It's just a big P.I.T.A. to use, and it takes too long to respond. Don't try to voice dial 911. You'll die before the call's been made (maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit! lol). The memory's decent, but that was never a complaint of mine with the original, either. From a non-smartphone point of view, this phone may intimidate those who are not very tech-savvy. It took awhile for me to get used to the Rugbys after having a more ""consumer-ized"" phone. Initially I felt like Jethro Gibbs (NCIS fans).. ""how does this damn thing work?"" ""Can't you reboot it?"" LOL The front display powers off too quickly, but that is also true of the original Rugby. Now that my faith in Samsung has turned slightly for the better again, I'm getting a Samsung WEP570 bluetooth earpiece. I'll review that soon, too. Potential Rugby II users: It's not as super cool as other phones out there, but it'll 'git 'er done.' Just be prepared to be patient. It's NOT lightning fast.. Oh, and you still can't read or reply to texts when you're on a call, but you can send them. And that kind of defeats the purpose of texting.",

I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn't know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a ""Rugged"" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen. This phone was definatley a waste of time, energy and money for us and an example of poor customer service on the part of Samsung.

The planet's largest telecommunications company sent a note advising their non-support for excellence but offering a ""free"" upgrade at an ATT store. I went in. Now the story gets ugly. 1. The store employees urged against the several ""free"" phones, pointing out that they were unpopular models for which ATT was discontinuing sale. They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia. They replied, ""None,"" but did recommend the misnamed Rugby as the next best thing. The catch: since I was declining a ""free"" phone, I'd need to buy the ""reliable"" model. 3. In ""upgrading"" to a worse phone, ATT charged an additional upgrade fee, cut my minutes in half, and locked in a new 2 year contract. Because I was leaving on a business trip for the Middle East the next day, I sucked it up and bought the Rugby. The story gets uglier. 1. The phone seriously overheats after about 15 minutes of use. 2. The buttons and menu are aggressively counter-intuitive. 3. The voice quality is the the worst I have ever encountered. 4. The PTT feature has been located such that it cannot be avoided--and which brings additional charges when used. (But this can be disabled. Pry out the button, then clip the stem from its back.

As a result, I've received the PTT initialization prompt about three dozen times during my first two days of ownership. If you WANT PTT, that might not be so bad; but I want neither to use nor to pay for the feature, so this is a problem I encounter virtually every time I use the phone. I used the Samsung web site to ask how I might go about disabling the feature and received a response revealing that Samsung doesn't know how to do it. They suggested that I get in touch with my service provider, which I will do eventually, but I am stunned that Samsung doesn't have a fix for this. I would not have purchased the phone if I had known about this problem. This is my first -- and likely my last -- product from Samsung, and I don't much like their web site either.

My father who is quite inept with technology and notoriously hard on his phones chose the Rugby as it seemed to offer simplicity and durability. It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw.

The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that's it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the 'mass storage' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn't work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung ""New PC Studio"" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung ""New PC Studio"" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not 'sync' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today's world, an 'advanced' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not 'sync' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable.

This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor. As my thumb wedged between the keypad and the screen to flip it open, it turned off. I lost it. I threw the phone into the wall and it shattered into pieces. The phone is no longer a problem now. I started using my old Samsung Propel - which suffered severe water damage and worked nonetheless, btw - and am infinitely more pleased.

B003P2VNAQ,J. Nicholas,4,"May 7, 2011",FALSE,This is a great phone for those not interested in smartphones,"I've had this phone for over a year now and have to say, it's done quite well for me. It's not too technical with the features and has a front screen on the outside. Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.",
B003P2VNAQ,loce_the_wizard,1,"June 26, 2011",FALSE,28 days later and . . .,". . . my second Samsung Rugby II phone has been returned to the point of purchase. I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating ""push to talk"" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too. I guess many of you love your Rugby phones, and I am glad you had better experiences with yours than I did with either of the two I tried.",
B003P2VNAQ,EGC10,1,"November 21, 2011",FALSE,All Physical,"After using the new Samsung Rugby II cell phone from AT&T for almost a year now, I am still struggling and still just as frustrated with it as I was when I first starting to use it. Although the physical features of the phone are very nice, there are too many technical inconveniences about the phone from the text messaging to the general usage of the phone that have caused me to literally hate it. When Alltel made the switch to AT&T after being bought out, I was forced to choose a new phone from a list of phones comparable to the current phone I had at the time. I really liked the current phone I had because it was simple and easy to use so I knew what to look for in a new phone, provided it had a rugged body, and a few new perks. After reviewing each of the phones and their features, there was only one phone that filled that description. I chose the Samsung Rugby II after reviewing all of its features and descriptions displayed on the AT&T website. I was not familiar with AT&T phones or the particular type of phone at the time, so I had to go out on a whim to assume it was as good as it sounded. The website explained all of the physical features that made the phone unique as well as a few technological features. The physical features the website displayed were the ruggedized body which could withstand shock, humidity, high temperatures, resist dirt, and repel rain. Some of the technological features displayed were Push-to-Talk (PTT) capability, which is like a walkie-talkie in your phone, and built in GPS. The physical features of the phone are true to what the website states. The body of the phone is heavy and thick; a rugged body that has stood up to a few crashes to the ground without problems. The battery cover has a twist lock on it that seals it tight to the phone to prevent water or humidity from seeping in, and good seals along the outside to resist dirt and rain. The physical features are all a plus, especially to someone who works construction or such job that a phone would benefit from those features. My problems came with the technology of the phone. My first problem was more with the company in the fact that the built in GPS and PTT capabilities were not included with the plan and would cost an extra $9.99/ month for each, putting almost twenty extra dollars on my bill each month. The website did not state that those features were add-ons or that they would cost extra. Not to mention, there are two buttons on the phone specifically for GPS and PTT features and if I hit one of them on accident, I could get charged. There are very little customizing features that allow me to change what buttons do what which makes it difficult to avoid pushing buttons that will take me to the internet and charge me. My second problem(s) were with calls and call waiting, receiving text and voicemails, and the phone turning off at random times. If the phone goes out of the service area, I have to turn the phone off and back on to make a phone call once back in the service area. If I receive a call waiting, the phone will not automatically switch back to original call once the call waiting has hung up; I have to manually do it, which has caused me to hang up on people by pushing the button too much. If receive a text message or voicemail while out of service, I will sometimes not receive them for as many as three days later for some unknown reason. At times, when I am on the phone connected to my Bluetooth, my phone will re-start itself while I am on the phone with someone, causing the call to be disconnected. One minor issue that caused a big problem was with the alarm. If the phone is on vibrate or silent, the alarm is too, so if I didn't want to be disturbed in the middle of the night by drunk-dialers or prank calls, I'd better had a back-up plan. I found that out when I received a phone call from work wondering if I was coming in or not as I was already an hour late. Most phones will turn themselves on if an alarm is set to go off and the phone is off. But my most hated part of this phone has to be the text messaging. With a new phone I expected the text messaging to be even better then it was when the T9 option came out. T9 is suppose to be faster because it is suppose to predict the text you are going to write. That is not the case; in fact, on this phone it is even worse than ever. This phone has to have more steps then the world trade center to write and send a text. It does not recognize frequently used words or phrases so I am constantly pushing more buttons to switch to the word I want then if I was just to do it manually. It does not show predictions for the word I am going to type and I have to delete an entire word just to change one letter. I also have to go through about six steps just to send the message. Basically, texting for me is slower then to just call the person I want to talk to. There is no reason for me to keep this phone and the physical features are not worth the frustration this phone has caused me. I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring new technologies out once I have had enough time to play around with them but, in this case I have had this phone for almost a year do not feel as though I should still be confused by it. In this day of technology, I would think we would be past this point. This phone seems to have been a step down from that and I hope AT&T will recognize that.",

I clicked the activate option and was put on hold for a very reasonable period of time while being entertained by Spanish guitar music. The marketing rep answered. To my amazement the rep informed me that I had won a $500 gift and that all I needed to do was pay $14.95 to have it shipped to my door. I reported that I was not interested in the gift but the marketer was persistent. I finally hung up without activation. The next day I tried again and dialed *611.

For another, the camera ""feature"" in this phone is useless.

The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won't work either.

About 4 months ago, my son was playing around and his phone ""flew"" out the window of a moving bus. We went back and recovered the phone from the side of the road. The battery was about 20 feet away and the cover was in the opposite direction. To my amazement, we put the phone back together and the phone worked immediately, only had some minor cosmetic damage. Last night we had a terrible storm and the phone was plugged in and charging. A transformer blew outside and a power surge rushed through my house. The phone started smoking and the back cover melted. The inside is scortched and smells like an electrical fire. To my amazement, after the phone cooled off and stopped smoking, we attempted to turn it on. The phone turned on and worked beautifully!!! I think this phone is indestructible! I am ordering a new one for my son. Gave him the choice of this stripped down phone or a fancier one. He wants this one because it can't be broken. No complaints!!!!",2

B0046REOWS,J.L. Populist,5,"December 30, 2010",FALSE,A Surprise for a Freebie,I bought this refurbished cell phone directly from Net10 online as part of a package deal. It was basically free with the purchase of a 30 day/750 minute phone card. I also got the universal accessories kit free. I have used this phone for a month. Last week I dropped it on a hard floor. After putting the battery and cover back on it the phone has shown no damage or problems. It appears to be durable and still works very well. Three things make an impression on me. 1) This phone is small. Not clunky. 2) Signal reception is great. No dropped calls yet! 3) The quality. I expected that a free phone in this price range would be loose or cheaply built. This phone is much better than that. The other surprise was the universal accessory kit which usually goes for around $15. It came free with a promotion code that I used during the purchase. The phone pouch is durable and the attachments are quality items. Everything works including the car charger. If you read the fine print on the Net10 website they normally send the phones with a battery and a home/wall charger. Net10 service is dependable and the phone cards can cost as little as 3 cents/minute up to the 10 cents/minute standard cards available in stores. I did call Net10 customer support to verify my order and out of curiosity about their service. What I found was that the initial response wasn't very good but I was passed off to another service tech who answered my questions quickly. This may be an instance where it depends on the particular tech that answers your call. But I did get an efficient human response to my call. Reloading minutes is easy and hassle-free also. Based on my experience so far I plan on staying with Net10. I would definitely buy this phone again.,53

I have a landline phone at home so the T201G is used for emergency use, away from home use, etc. I purchase only 200 mins per month with a plan that cost about 7.5 cents per minute. With tax, about $16.70 per month for the 200 minutes and service. Any leftover minutes roll over each month and are never lost as long as you keep the service. This phone and the Net10 service have been excellent in my opinion. Talk time is around 4 hours and standby time is almost 2 weeks before charging is needed. I even purchased a spare battery for when we travel and alternate batteries every couple months. I love it when my wife goes shopping in town and can keep in touch for such a low monthly cost. If you only need a phone part time for emergency, travel, etc., this is a great bargain. Highly recommend.",2

Yes, you've read it right, 6 years! I came from AT&T. I got tired of being on a plan, so I went from a package with AT&T to a pay-as-you-go with AT&T. When rates started inching up and my bill cost more, it was time for me to switch. I stumbled upon Net10. They had flip phones, carry over minutes and cost effective pay-as-you-go. I ordered the phone plus accessories. It arrived quickly! Set-up was prompt when I called in and I have that phone, Motorola V171, to this day. I am currently looking to change, as my family puts it, ""catch up with 2008, at least"" so I am getting a phone that will accept photo texts, so that my sisters can send me photos of my nieces. Now to inform you why I scored them a 4 instead of a 5. - The customer service is not what is was when I first signed up with them. When I do call in for a question it takes FOREVER to get someone and then once I do, we have a language barrier, so BE PATIENT. - I hate that they got rid of their 1 year pre-paid card 1500 minutes for $150 or $100 (I can't remember which one Now there is a $100 card for 1000 minutes lasting 9 months, I believe. Other than that, if you are in to fancy phones and you're a HEAVY phone user, Net10 may not be for you. They have 2 pay plans $15(150 minutes) and $25 per month(250 minutes)none are roll over. Then there is the pay-as-you-go (with roll over minutes). They don't carry iphones and their phones are approx. 2 years behind the lastest and greatest. I would recommend Net10 for all others who want a cell phone for practical purposes and could care less about the fanciness of a phone. I hope this helps.",14

I will continue to use the Samsung Convoy until I am forced to switch to a ""smarter"" cell phone with a pricey data plan (which I have no doubt will eventually happen) but the batteries for this cell phone are cheap and stay charged for a week. Show me a smart phone that can do that.",11

B004C7NVD0,JR,4,"March 8, 2014",TRUE,Samsung U640 Great Flip Phone !!,"Purchased used from NuTwo on Amazon. It was rated as in ""very good"" condition. I would rate it as in excellent condition. The packaging was professional / good quality. The phone arrived ahead of schedule. Highly recommend seller. Now to the phone itself: *Speech / Sound: Very clear sound quality, even the speakerphone mode is very clear with minimum distortion when volume @ max Contacts on other end of phone conversation have indicated they can hear me very clearly w/ good tone & no distortion. Has option to answer call & talk w/ flip closed. (I really like this option) *Screens / Keypad Inside and outside screens are large enough to read (I'm over 50 and have slightly degraded vision). Font adjustment is adequate. Screens are clear and bright. The phone feels and appears sturdy (not water proof / resistant). The flip screen is easy to open / close. The inside keys are large enough so someone with larger hands won't push extra keys by mistake and someone with less than perfect vision can see them clear enough. The keys have a very good / responsive feel. The software menus are adequately easy to navigate and customize. Camera / MicroSD / USB / Bluetooth: The 2.0Mp camera is good. The camcorder function works well. The only drawback is no flash or light assist. The U660 model has the flash / flashlight. The good news is it's Micro SD slot. I inserted a 16GB Sandisk MicroSD and it worked flawlessly for both pics and camcorder. You are given option to save photos / video to limited internal memory then xfer to SD, or you can set option in phone to automatically save to SD. I have a USB data cable on order and have not tried moving data to PC via USB. I'm hoping xferring contacts will be as easy as the SD setup. There are external keys for taking pics / video without opening phone. This phone is also capable of voice command. I played with it briefly and seems to work o.k. but haven't really been into it yet. The phone has Blue Tooth capability and I do plan on ordering a wireless / hands free headset, I just haven't landed on one yet. **Speakerphone is good for voice, but if you're going to play tunes you might want to consider decent headphones or play on other audio device. I plugged in mid-grade headphones and tunes sounded good. Internet: This phone is 3G. Aside from that I can't say much other than it appears to work well. I really don't browse the net on phone, I use PC for that. Carrier compatibility: The phone I purchased is a Verizon / contract (not pre-paid) / CDMA / no simm card / clear ESN. **This phone IS compatible with Calif. Lifeline through ReachOut (Nexus owns ReachOut / Verizon owns Nexus) Cons: *No Cam light (U660 has light) *Vibrate mode a little wimpy, could be slightly stronger Conclusions: Great phone for us ""throw back"" flip phone users who aren't ready for a smart phone yet. This phone has more capability than I will ever use. I have only scratched the surface of the software options.",7

This is the same model phone that Consumer Reports rated a best buy at the time I bought it the first time 10 years ago or more. Customer reviews of subsequent models have said that this one is the best. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a rugged phone with great voice quality and a lit keypad with keys big enough for my big hands. By rugged I mean that I dropped my first one on the floor a number of times over the years without breaking it. I got Verizon on the phone and made sure my contacts were backed up and then activated the phone. Easy! As for TargetWireless, I started by asking them a question. I had an answer back within two hours. I ordered the phone. They shipped it the same day. It arrived earlier than promised, looking new in a small white box with places for the phone and charger, both in little plastic bags. It even has clear thin protective covers on the displays!

Previous phone was Android on Sprint. The call quality is clear as can be. Camera takes very good 8mp photos. Apps in the market are made for Windows OS so they work. No bloat ware (there were a few programs pre-installed from AT&T, however these can be uninstalled). Cons: No external storage (knew this before I bought it), app market is smaller than Android's (but how many of those apps are duplicates). The only real con I can think of is the placement of the USB charging port, it's on the top of the phone, but not a deal breaker and I'm sure I'll get used to it.",

I also think there is much wasted space on the front face at the top and bottom, that the screen doesn't use. Wish it had a 4.5 or better yet a 4.7 inch screen.

I got home last night and it was in my box and I haven't been able to put it down yet!!! The only thing I didn't like though was having to use Zune for my music player, not a deal breaker though.

B00836Y6B2,White,5,"March 3, 2013",TRUE,Nokia Lumia 900...an owner review for the everyday person.,"This phone is great! It's the best phone I've ever owned. I have been a dedicated high end Android user, but I found this phone to be a much more satisfying experience than either the iPhone or the Android phones. I want an OS that will meet my current needs and have a great user interface with a good amount of apps available for me to manage my daily mobile cell phone use, and not have to make expensive phone upgrades all the time. The Nokia Lumia 900 is a very well constructed phone.The aesthetics are pleasing, it's modern and function goes well beyond my expectations. It operates very fast and smooth even though it has a single core processor and only 512MB on RAM. If you are not aware of these specs, you might think it has a multi-core processor and more RAM on board. Nokia has come up with a phone that is both pleasing in design and very efficient when it comes to performance. The screen is bright with beautiful color saturated screen, and seems to have less glare outside when it's sunny. I can actually read the screen in such conditions. This is a big plus for me! It has 16GB of ROM, which is plenty by itself, but pared with the 7GB of frees cloud storage, it's more than enough for me. I really don't know what the fuss is about concerning the number of apps available for Windows Phones. Unless you are some kind of developer or techy person, there are plenty of apps available for this phone (both from MS, Nokia and third party) for the everyday cell phone user, even business user. The game apps seems so much more refined (probably because there are a lot of Xbox games available for this phone) and they run beautifully on this phone. I travel a lot and I'm really looking forward to using this phone on my trips. I have always liked Nokia phones because of the quality build and support. When I started using a smartphone I got away from Nokia phones and started my Android experience. Now that Nokia has chosen to team up with MS to re-enter the smartphone market, I wanted to try their phones again. What a lovely surprise! I'm crazy for the Lumia 900 and look forward to future offerings from Nokia, if and when I get tired of this phone or need to upgrade. I recommend this phone, it's quality at affordable prices. Great design, sturdy, fast and very easy to use, especially if you run Windows 8 on your computer. Try it! You won't be sorry. By it from Amazon, the best place to shop and that's coming from a person that doesn't or ever has worked for them. I forgot to tell you that there is an upgrade of the operating system to 7.8, which is very similar to Windows 8, available for this phone. It's very easy to install, just install Zune on your Windows computer, connect your phone to USB, and it will find the upgrade and instruct you how to install.",81

The screen just blew me away and the OS is very fast and user friendly. This is the first time I try a Windows phone and I have to say that it's been a wonderful experience. From now on I'll just use Windows phone for my daily use. My next gadget will be Nokia Lumia 920. I just can't look foward for this phone to hit the market. Nokia designs the best and most beautiful phones and now they work with the best OS on the market. Well done, Nokia and Microsoft! Now, let's talk about Apps. I've read many comments of people talking about the ''lack of app'' on the Marketplace. I can tell my own experience. I come from Android and also I had a Apple iPhone 4S and the only App missing on the Marketplace (talking about me and the apps I use the most) are Instagram and OVO (and I've heard Instagram is comming soon to Windows Phones before this year ends). I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MSN, KiK, Viber, Badoo, SkyDrive, Tango, Skype,Youtube,Shazam, SoundHound, Netflix, IMDb, Evernote, ESPN, CNN, Univision,SkyMap, TuneIn Radio, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and Weather much more... Also the Nokia App (Nokia Maps, Drive, City Lens, Music, Trailers, Creative Studio, Counters, Soundtracker, Transit, Contacts Transfer, Camera Extras and much more). The Marketplace keeps growing. The integration of Facebook, twitter, MSN, LinkedIn and Foursquare in my Windows Phone is AMAZING! I can put comments and give ''likes'' directly from my phone due to the AMAZING integretion between those Apps and my phone. and I don't have to go to the Facebook or Twitter App to do that. I'm totally in love with my Nokia Lumia 900 and its amazing OS! I 100% recommend it! If you wanna be different, switch and go for it! Nokia Lumia phones the amazing experience!",70

I tested it on the NET10 network, (which uses AT&T) with the impression that Nokia phones were good, but the Windows software was not....it turned out the Nokia phone is the best I have ever owned, the Windows 7.8 is also very good. The phone is very attractive and has caught a lot of attention, it is extremely well built, very clear screen, with scratch free gorilla glass and a rigid case made of some kind of resin. Pluses... Calls are very clear, Both cameras are amazing, the flash is also very good. The camera button is very conveniently located. The charge lasts all day better than previous phones. The speaker is excellent for a tiny device like this...I am very impressed. Skype is just phenomenal on this phone! best quality sound and video I have ever seen on a phone! All the APPS I need are there! Nokia Maps...BRILLIANT! Bing Translater....BRILLIANT! I also use Skype, Google voice, Watsapp, Amazon Mobile/Kindle, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Tune In Radio & Tango on this phone! Has yet to freeze or crash after two weeks. A first! Minuses There is no external memory slot (though it does have a built in 16GB memory, more than enough for my needs) Battery is non-removable (shame) Conclusion. This phone has really impressed me and I would recommended it to anyone who needs a well built phone that is reliable, with clear calls and decent battery life! Is it better than an I phone? No idea, never owned one! It is better, way better than some Android phones I have owned but I am sure as good as the current higher end Android, it just depends on your personal preferences. As regards ""APPS"" I found all the apps I needed, Nokia Maps is an impressive stand in for Google Maps, Bing Translater is really very impressive too!

B00836Y6B2,Jen,1,"April 8, 2015",FALSE,You can't spell Windows technology without sh*t.,"When this phone arrived, there was a not-so-minor issue with the screen-- it wouldn't turn off. I immediately contacted Windows and discovered that purchasing the phone through Amazon means that it does not come with the ""guaranteed"" 1-year warranty ordinarily associated with all Windows products. Normally, I would take full blame for not conducting proper consumer research. However, this is a factory issue, as indicated by two different Windows technicians. It's disheartening to know that this company refuses to take pride in their products and repair or replace the item. At one point, I even drove 1 hour to a Windows store because they promised to resolve the issue. Upon arrival, the technician turned down the brightness, downloaded an awful energy saving app, then told me it was fixed. It wasn't. My phone lives on a charger because it dies within one hour of being unplugged. At the same time, it is not usable while plugged in. It's like owning a tiny, dying man who needs to be put out of his misery. Most USB cables and public charging stations do not work for this device. So, if it dies and you have a thousand USB cables at your disposal, it doesn't matter. Nothing helps. On multiple occasions it didn't work when I needed it most. It's refusal to properly charge in a reasonable amount of time means that 911 and other emergency services are not easy to contact. It takes 6 hours to charge to 100% using the cable included in the box. There are almost no useful apps compatible with this device, which is a given because it's a Windows product. When you sync it with a computer, then you can no longer download podcasts or music directly from the Marketplace. You will still be charged for the media, but it will not appear on your phone. The screen freezes 10-20 times each day. The camera button is dreadful, as is the inconsistent picture quality. You cannot listen to voicemails in public because of the strange set up for volume control. Normal phone calls are fine. But, when playing a voicemail, either you hear nothing, or everyone within 10 miles can hear about your doctor's appointments. The screenshot function is nonexistent. According to the discussion boards, it ""takes practice"" in order to ""get the hang of it."" I was never able to get it to work, and have tried upwards of 100 times. You have to push two buttons at the exact same time, which, though it sounds easy, is impossible because they are both too sensitive. If John Karlin, the father of Human Factors, was alive today, he would bid the Windows company a harshly worded ""good day to you, sir."" I'm buying an iphone.",
B00836Y6B2,Shawkins,3,"February 21, 2013",FALSE,Nice phone with issues,"I purchased my phone new at an AT&T store, not through Amazon. This phone is not as intuitive as others. Granted I'm used to the Android system and iPhones and have never used a Microsoft operating system on a cell phone. First disappointment was that some apps are completely inaccessible, including Amazon mp3 which I'm sure isn't the most popular app out there, but if you've invested any money in purchasing music throught it, it's a pain to no longer have access to that music through that app. There is no place to access downloads. Once something is downloaded, it is filtered into what the phone decides is an appropriate place. Bank apps download into the ""Wallet"" app installed on the phone. Others of my downloads have simply disappeared into the phone somewhere and I've had several people search for access to them to no avail. This includes apps and documents. I've had this phone a week and already it is doing.. odd things. Today it decided to randomly fade the screen's brightness from well lit to almost invisible (regardless of the amount of time since I'd last touched the screen and on a full battery) and then fades back to normal, repeating the fading in and out multiple times. On other phones I've used, when you use the internet and then close out to do something else.. take a call, use another app, check a text, you can open the internet back to the page you were just viewing... not with this phone. It goes back to your starting bing, google, whatever default page and if you hit the back button it just closes the internet. Also, if you receive an incoming call from someone not in your contacts and want to save the phone number to your contacts, there is no way to do so??? I'm not completely incompetent.. I've selected every possible option and there is no way to directly select that phone number and save it into contacts. It requires you to select one of your contacts' names from your newly created hotmail account (unless of course you already have one) to save the number under. If this person isn't in my hotmail account already, then what? Too many mandatory steps linking to hotmail. I'd rather just have the ability to synchronize without having to manually do it every time I want to do something simple like save a phone number. These things may be able to be worked through, but with hassle. The phone looks great. It's operating system is just, like I said, not intuitive and even during this first week of being on a new phone high, I'm already becoming disenchanted with the phone. The reason I chose this phone is for the Microsoft Suite's amazing functioning on this phone. I've tried using Word and Excel with other phones and it was possible, albeit annoying. Using Excel on this phone is amazing.. almost better than my laptop. So for someone regularly needing that ability, this phone may be worth the other issues. I would say I like the phone, but considering all the other options available at this price point, I may return it. Don't be sold on the camera either.. if you get the sales pitch on it you'll know what I'm referring to. I tried to take a still pic of a plant (nothing moving, me or the plant) and it continuously came out blurry.",21

Well there is no way to copy the whole thing and paste it, you got to re-write it all on each day independently on the calendar. -No tile color and/or size customize by user (a Tile is like a icon for shortcuts to a desired function or application) -What happened to saving contacts on the phone?? Only on a E-mail account?? -if you are entering a phone number that already exists on your contacts (but you don't know) it won't tell you it already exists. -No adding feature of related apps to a single ""tile"" to group them (as on iPhone) -Sometimes people can get dizzy scrolling all the way down (or through) the endless ""tile"" collection set up you might end up having, trying to make short cuts to phone functions. -They claim Zune (the connection app for PC and Lumia phones win7) is the ultimate software, but then again a set back in evolution..

This phone is barely 2yrs old and resembles an early model of a phone from 2001! The only thing that I would consider is great about this phone is the battery life!

B00836Y6B2,spaceman spiff,2,"August 25, 2013",FALSE,Continuous problems and lacks support,"I've had the Nokia Lumina 900 for about a year and have not had a positive experience. I initially purchased it through Best Buy for a two year AT&T contract. I had multiple Nokia phones in the past (the awesome indestructible Meme ones) and was really excited about this phone because it was my first smart phone and I did not want an iPhone. Long story short, this phone looks nice, but it has given me nothing but problems. About two weeks ago I woke up one morning to it being worse than ever. I have not dropped it or done anything to break it. There is no visible external damage but the issues that it has are significant (detailed below). I went into Best Buy and they told me to contact Nokia. I contacted Nokia and kept asking for help to get it fixed (even for a fee) and they said that there was nothing they could do - that I would need to take it to a third party repair vendor. Right now I'm looking at other phones and having to pay outside of contract. The Pros: - Looks sleek. I do like the Windows UI with the tiles. People do like it and comment on it. Because I've had good luck with Nokia in the past and I did like this phone initially before the issues started, I will give it two stars. - Size. I've seen many different phones and after using this phone and getting used to it, the iPhones seems to small and the Galaxys seem too big. This one feels just right. The Cons: - Camera: I've compared the camera to my friend's iPhones and Galaxy pictures and I have to say I prefer their pictures more. The Lumina 900's pictures offer less brightness and contrast and end up being darker and blurrier in my experience. - Battery life currently ~ 2 hrs (I've had it about a year and expected the battery to still be going strong). - Messaging and internet does not work (this is broken for me, so my experience may be atypical) - Windows OS. It has some good points and some bad. I do not like how they require MS Zune for updates. Added account flexibility would also help instead of forcing Windows Live. It comes across as Windows forcing people to use their peripheral products when I don't need it. I don't know too many people who have a Windows Live accounts as their primary email. I know this is the OS and not the hardware, but it does make a difference. - Initially group texts would just be seen as a single text from one person, and if you replied it would only go to him or her and not the group. That was frustrating for planning. - The Customer Support. I emailed them with my problems and they sent canned replies each time until by the third time they just said they could not help. I know this lack of support is common through the industry, but I still don't like it. - I've had common issues of it just shutting down and glitching and sometimes missing calls since about a few months after getting it. It got a lot worse about two weeks ago and I'm not sure what happened. Overall I may have just received a lemon phone, so take my review for what it is. If you get one that works, then I'd be a fine phone. Didn't work for me and I'll probably try another manufacturer out next.",
B00836Y6B2,Joel Moreno,5,"November 17, 2012",FALSE,Amazing experience!,"I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and it is gorgeous. The screen just blew me away and the OS is very fast and user friendly. This is the first time I try a Windows phone and I have to say that it's been a wonderful experience. From now on I'll just use Windows phone for my daily use. My next gadget will be Nokia Lumia 920. I just can't look foward for this phone to hit the market. Nokia designs the best and most beautiful phones and now they work with the best OS on the market. Well done, Nokia and Microsoft! Now, let's talk about Apps. I've read many comments of people talking about the ''lack of app'' on the Marketplace. I can tell my own experience. I come from Android and also I had a Apple iPhone 4S and the only App missing on the Marketplace (talking about me and the apps I use the most) are Instagram and OVO (and I've heard Instagram is comming soon to Windows Phones before this year ends). I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MSN, KiK, Viber, Badoo, SkyDrive, Tango, Skype,Youtube,Shazam, SoundHound, Netflix, IMDb, Evernote, ESPN, CNN, Univision,SkyMap, TuneIn Radio, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and Weather much more... Also the Nokia App (Nokia Maps, Drive, City Lens, Music, Trailers, Creative Studio, Counters, Soundtracker, Transit, Contacts Transfer, Camera Extras and much more). The Marketplace keeps growing. The integration of Facebook, twitter, MSN, LinkedIn and Foursquare in my Windows Phone is AMAZING! I can put comments and give ''likes'' directly from my phone due to the AMAZING integretion between those Apps and my phone. and I don't have to go to the Facebook or Twitter App to do that. I'm totally in love with my Nokia Lumia 900 and its amazing OS! I 100% recommend it! If you wanna be different, switch and go for it! Nokia Lumia phones the amazing experience!",102

But then we did a comparison up against the iPhone 5 and the Nokia bombed. Pictures from iPhone much sharper. The streaming interface for Netflix on iPhone much better (on the same network). The calendar (now this is a software not a hardware issue) was difficult to use - I use a lot of calendar functionality. Now it was much cheaper than the iPhone for sure and the Windows 8 UI is awesome - so much better than iPhone. But if you need pictures to be crisp and good and need slick video - iPhone, iPhone, iPhone - but if you want to spend a little less and have less apps but have nice integration with outlook and xBox - definitely get this phone.

So if you are a busy person and like technology to improve your timing working routing, this is not a phone I would recommend.. Because many ""Basic"" cell functions are missing in the software wp7, and the only option you'll find is to search endlessly the ""market place"" to find app that may or may not suit your needs, download them, install them and use them for a while to see if they really work for you..

Only on a E-mail account?? -if you are entering a phone number that already exists on your contacts (but you don't know) it won't tell you it already exists. -No adding feature of related apps to a single ""tile"" to group them (as on iPhone) -Sometimes people can get dizzy scrolling all the way down (or through) the endless ""tile"" collection set up you might end up having, trying to make short cuts to phone functions. -They claim Zune (the connection app for PC and Lumia phones win7) is the ultimate software, but then again a set back in evolution..

But not a phone!! -Nice prediction help while typing, but needs an UNDO and back/forth cursor option, and improve finger selection -Many things can be ""Pin to start"" (but size and color can't be customized) but then again, you'll end with a long selection of tiles and therefore scrolling endlessly through them to find the one you need to click -""forward"" is hidden under reply button for sync email accounts ..and you better have a 20 20 sight NOTE: I bought this phone because I used to be a Nokia fan.. I have tried to love this device but has disappointed me in a way I didn't expect.. for a ""smart phone"" no so smart.. NOTE: Never the less, I see potential in this device, with an update (or Updates, that I doubt would happen) this would be one of the best and complete smartphones!

Well, mine is not the exception !!! it shuts down very frequently and unexpectedly, very annoying !! IN THE OTHER HAND If your life is lacking emotions and adventure.. You'll find this phone very amusing and entertaining... And time consuming.. -Nice connectivity to the internet, this is more of a internet, social networking device and software... But not a phone!! -Nice prediction help while typing, but needs an UNDO and back/forth cursor option, and improve finger selection -Many things can be ""Pin to start"" (but size and color can't be customized) but then again, you'll end with a long selection of tiles and therefore scrolling endlessly through them to find the one you need to click -""forward"" is hidden under reply button for sync email accounts ..and you better have a 20 20 sight NOTE: I bought this phone because I used to be a Nokia fan.. I have tried to love this device but has disappointed me in a way I didn't expect.. for a ""smart phone"" no so smart.. NOTE: Never the less, I see potential in this device, with an update (or Updates, that I doubt would happen) this would be one of the best and complete smartphones!

B00836Y6B2,Dr. Jefe,1,"December 16, 2012",FALSE,The Lumia 920 Failure,"I wanted to like it, I really did. I just purchased a new Win8 computer and figured I would upgrade my phone to the Lumia 920 in the spirit of homogeneity. Let me tell you that doing so was a HORRIBLE idea - where to start. Weight - this brick, I mean phone, tips the scales at a cool 185 grams, compared to the 133 gram Galaxy S3 or 140 gram iPhone 4S. When asked why it weighed so much, the salesman told me it was because the phone is made from the same composite as is astronaut helmets. Nice - I can now sleep better knowing that if the Mayans are right, at least my Lumia 920 is prepared for its journey through the cosmos. To all my skinny jean wearing hipsters, you and this phone simply cannot be - the sheer size and mass of it make it a nightmare to carry in regular sized pants, I can't even imagine the kind of dances you'll do to get the Lumia in and out of your jeggings pockets. This brick could be a safety hazard if one of these crazy youths tries to rob me on his way to Hot Topic, though my Lumia could possibly double as a shield, or even a weapon if I decided to shotput at my assailant. Onto the UI - wow, anyone who says the apps are incredible must be kidding. Moving past the fact that google refuses to create apps for the Win8 OS, none of the apps that are built for this phone are designed by their actual developers. Facebook is a Microsoft app, Whatsapp doesn't even exist, the Pandora app is a blog about the music on Pandora - sweet, nothing satiates my hunger for The Jonas Brothers or Biggie Smalls like the words of Joe and Jane Smith as they opine on hottest 1950's Christmas album. What few games they do have, i.e. angry birds, looks like they have been shrunk down from a tv screen onto my phone. The aspect ratio is atrocious, not to mention that for me to download anything, I have to use my Hotmail account that I opened and retired when I was in fifth grade - which may be a real selling point for the hipsters as eclectic/old school schwag is all the rage these days. As per the screen size ... the phone may be huge but a good portion of it is cannibalized by the bezel , again probably some brilliant innovation necessary to make the phone more functional as I use it to fend off attacks but not when I want to compose documents in MS office, which is a function I will NEVER use on my phone. But our friends at Nokia were smart enough to include a wireless charger, this was a HUGE plus, I find that plugging my phone into the wall while I sleep at night is cumbersome AND tedious. Corded phones chargers are so 2010 - what are we still using the rotary phones here? Think of all the extra things I can do now that I don't have to plug my brick into the wall! At about 6 hours of battery life, I know that whatever charging device I get is going to get plenty of love. So that's it, this phone is horrible. Anyone who says otherwise is either crazy, or is finally making the upgrade from their Razor flip phone. Keep up the good work Nokia, you've successfully kept old school by giving us those old school features we expected in 2005.",4
B00836Y6B2,Mr.J,1,"October 28, 2012",FALSE,Windows does not make a SMART phone,"OK, so I own the Lumia 900 and have since the May release date. While it is a stylish phone of good build quality, you cannot judge a book by it's cover - which is the only place where the quality of this phone shines. It's pretty, but..... So, Microsoft made a phone that is already obsolete, cannot use ANY instant messaging applications or multitask properly, and has numerous flaws that are just add up to a frustrating experience. Not to mention that suppliers and third party companies are avoiding the Windows phone platform almost entirely. Go to the electronics store and try comparing how many accessories you can find for all the other phones with what you can find for the Lumia 900 - it's beyond sad. And the software!! I had a Blackberry that ran the mobile MS Office applications with better functionality and feature-set than the MS hardware, MS software combination of the Lumia. And MS owns Skype but wait, wait... nope, it doesn't work on the Lumia. (unless you disable your screen from timing out {dead battery} and keep Skype as the running app on the screen {switch to another app and Skype logs out}) Running one app works fine, but how smart is it to install an instant messaging application on a phone that cannot run instant messaging while you're doing something like, let's say, looking at the home screen of the phone to see what time it is. Pathetic. I'm a sucker who used to have faith in Microsoft products, so I gave this phone a chance and believed all the fan-boy hyped reviews. Repeat - I am the sucker. Please, don't join the crowd of disappointed people who are now wondering if they can find anyone stupid enough to buy a used Lumia off of them so that they can escape to the capable platform of Android or, dare I say it, Apple (and I hate Apple). If you love a pretty box and don't care about functionality - go for it, but if you actually want a capable smart-phone please save yourself before it's too late and forget this phone ever existed (like MS already did).",8

B00836Y6B2,Sophia H,5,"May 17, 2013",TRUE,First shot at living the unlocked life,"I have been using a Blackberry Curve for the last 3 1/2 years and avoiding a smartphone because of the additional costs associated with new activations. However, I decided that it may be time to upgrade since I would like to be able to use this phone overseas on travel. I did some research - thought about going with the new Blackberry Q10 - but the outright unlocked purchase price is high and I wanted to test out an unlocked GSM phone before I went hog wild on the phone of my dreams. I went with the 900 because it is affordable but not too outdated yet (although the 925 AT&T and 928 Verizon are already out). I read great reviews on the design and wanted to go with something other than the iPhone. I was not disappointed. Kudos to Feel Good Sales - the product was unlocked and worked right out of the box when I took it down to T-Mobile for a SIM card. It was just as advertised - new (AT&T), unlocked. Please keep in mind that there are many different vendors that sell under the same item number so you don't really know who the seller is. I chose to go with an Amazon Fulfilled seller, believing that there is a bit more consumer protection if they are responsible for the processing of the transaction. Also believing that if a seller uses Amazon to fulfill, they are probably selling what they're advertising since returns seem to be processed through Amazon also. In any case, be careful which vendor you choose and check their ratings. I read some of the reviews for other vendors (especially direct sales) that would lead me to believe that not all sellers are created equal. So, it's super easy to set up the Lumia 900 and I found lots of forum hints on it. The one thing that I had a problem with to start was sending and receiving MMS (pics through text). But I found a topic online that told me I needed to download the Network Setup app from Nokia and select my provider - it worked perfectly. Marketplace is really easy for downloading apps because I already have an Microsoft e-mail account. I am not a heavy user of apps so I don't really have much to say about them but they're there and I will probably look into them more. I have read lots of reviews saying the battery life is short but then so it is for the iPhone. Do your research but I think the Lumia 900 is a good choices - especially for me, as a starter smartphone that I wouldn't be afraid to take overseas. I think at some point, I might want to get a newer, international model - hopefully after they improve battery life (according to the critics). But in the meantime, I'm thrilled!",8

My sister and I had a head to head battle over who's smart phone was coolest she has an Iphone 5. In the middle of the text battle my phone screen froze. I had to turn off the phone and reboot. As a devote PC user we are all used to that. She laughed but I had a slighted chuckle as we discussed the bills. I have greater freedom and control of cost because I can switch carriers since my affordable smartphone is not tethered to one carrier she can not. Isn't this the classic PC vs Apple debate do you want a usable gadget that you afford or a perfect gadget that cost a mint? Things that Nokia can improve: No I am not getting a Microsoft account are you serious? Another account for me to forget the password to and spend money for app that are last week before I master them?No!!! Still have not got the radio app to work. Please how do you remove all that AT & T stuff? Other than that no complaints. Update, I have had this phone for four months and I can not receive picture that are texted to me and this phone does not work with Family Mobile data plan. I have downloaded updated and turn myself inside out trying to figure out what am I doing wrong. This phone although stating unlock can not be used to almost any but talk text and music storage without AT&T. I left AT&T because they are so expensive and in Chicago calls are dropped constantly I did not want to go back but here I am crawling back to AT&T buying a more expensive and limited data plan just to make this stupid phone work.

She adapted to it within a week and enjoys using it and seeing pictures of her grandkids and listening to some of her favorite artists. The OS is perfect for her because the tiles are big and she can easily access the weather, banking, pictures, etc. Had I gotten her iOS or Android with their small icons it would have been more of a transition for her to adapt coming from a non-smartphone flip phone. For the price it was worth it and I'm now looking to graduate her to WP8 this Xmas. The build quality is excellent as Nokia is known for that. If the phone is at a bargain price and you want to get this for your kids or parents just to make calls and access a few programs then I highly recommend this model from Nokia.",6

I had this phone for about 6 months ... compare to my previous android phone, it is simple and easy to use. Windows Phone operating system seems to work more flawlessly than android. (really??? how??) this phone uses a single core processor (supposedly 4 times slower processor), and 512MB RAM (again supposedly 4 times less RAM), but still works more flawlessly than my older android phone (which had better hardware) and android tablet. I am an engineer and a computer geek, but not a phone guru ... I am not a code or application developer :) All I want is a phone that does not get stuck, allows me to check my emails, some simple apps and perhaps games. For all these purposes it works just fine :) Sure it is not an iphone, but it works fine and cost much less :) I have been a big nokia fan for a long time. I would prefer the old symbian OS, but it is very old ... does not have a lot of applications etc. Would I recommend windows phone to others? definitely!!! Android phones need quad core processors, and 2GB ram because the operating system is not coded/written elegantly ... thus it needs more processing power to run it, and will probably use more battery power. Why most phone companies go with android then??? well ... it is an older OS ... they simply go with what the most common OS is ... Anyway ... I highly recommend windows OS ... sure it does not have 800 billion apps out there ... but do you really need 10 different versions of angry birds on your phone :)",
B00836Y6B2,Amazon Customer,2,"December 31, 2013",TRUE,Disappointing overall :(,"When I first got this phone I was really excited after hearing so many good things about it and all the nice features it has. However it's had a lot of problems and the store I bought it from on Amazon made it out to be a product made for the U.S. but it wasn't. As such there was no warranty on my phone and when it started having a lot of problems I had to return it. Amazon was really helpful in this as it was a couple months past the return date and they still gave me a partial refund. Nice Features: Camera: I love this camera. Takes beautiful pics especially up close photos with the macro setting. Colors always come out perfect in the daytime, but in any low light the colors come out really off. User Friendly: I do really like this about the phone. The tiles are fun and easy to use. I really liked the ability to shrink some of the tiles so that you could fit 4 in the place of a big tile, but this quit working on my phone after I was forced to restore it. Dislikes: Windows ''Marketplace:'' As windows is just starting out there aren't really any good apps. There's no good map app for one. Cold weather: This bugs me to no end. Any temperature below 60 degrees causes the phone to black out on the bottom half of the screen. If it's anywhere near 60 dark lines show up on the screen. You can still use the phone if you know where to click, but the blackened part is all pixely and it takes forever for it to go back to normal. Text/Pic Messaging: I bought this phone to use with Net10. I had to search around everywhere to find the correct codes to enter to get text and pic messaging to work but I finally found them. It worked for a couple months but then it just stopped working. I could send and receive texts, but I could only receive pics, I couldn't send them. It was really frustrating since Net10 technically doesn't ""guarantee'' pic messaging so they wouldn't help me. Overall, I was really looking forward to this phone, but it's really disappointing how much quit working. I don't know if just my phone is defective or if this has happened with a lot of people. But it really wasn't worth the money I just wish I would've figured it out while I could still get all my money back.",1

Nokia Apps and Espooteam apps are particularly good. Microsofts marketplace search engine is a joke (minus one star) so be willing to be patient and try different search words and the like to find what you need. Great phone though.

Signal: Good reception using either Etisalat/ROSHAN or AWCC service - plenty of supported apps left in the Nokia store...This is the best smart phone I have ever owned, EVER. I like it slightly better than my New LG Optimus G(!) which I just purchased for stateside use. The screen on this Lumina 900 is beyond HD compliant and quite bright outdoors even in direct sunlight - a very important feature! Battery life is as expected while WI-fi and GPS are enabled, BUT it charges rapidly -especially if using USB 3.0 rapid charge -then it's 'incredulous charging speed'. The phone is comfortable in the hand, not too large, perfect actually for my ordinary male-sized hand; the subtle black texture on the back is of a no-slip design; convenient button placement (especially power on/off); responsive touch/tactile screen. The Carl Zeiss Camera has a lot of available useful adjustments as well as 'set it and forget it' AUTO settings - Tested: picture quality is excellent - video quality is HD. Overall: Just Perfect - I purchased this as refurbished and unlocked for travel abroad.

I love the look of Windows Phone's UI and the integration of your photos and contacts into almost every corner of the OS is somewhat charming. That being said the gimped Windows 7 apps (Spotify) and complete lack of some of the most popular apps from the marketplace (Pandora) make me miss the days of my iPhone 4 and even my 1st gen Android. Technically the phone lags, and the apps often crash. APN settings will work one minute then stop the next, forcing you to reset the phone. The camera on the Lumia 900 is fantastic, sadly you will be hard pressed to find a quality photo editing app in the marketplace.

B00836Y6B2,Kevin Ramsey,5,"July 1, 2013",TRUE,Don't Listen to the Haters,"I purchased this phone after carefully researching my next phone purchase. I was tired of Boost and Virgin Mobile and the terrible service they provide and their watered down phones. Don't believe anyone who tells you the phones manufactured for these prepaid services are the same ones that are released to contract carriers. I had the EVO on Virgin Mobile and Samsung Galaxy on Boost and they were nothing like the same phones given to my friends from contract carriers. You get what you paid for. After receiving this phone I can truly say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I am as left leaning liberal as they come and it pains me to give the thumbs up to a major corporation, but the fact of the matter is that Nokia is a superior company to Samsung and HTC and AT&T invented the phone and has the largest 4G network. So when combined these two companies have created an untouchable product. This is my first windows phone and I can say that the OS is unbelievable. People choose Apple and Android b/c they are inherent Microsoft haters. However Microsoft powers the world whether they like it or not. This phone works smooth and the screen and looks are top notch. It never hangs or needs rebooting and the features actually work the first time you click them. The back button on Android is a joke there is no telling where it is taking you. When you press the back button on this phone, you go back to the previous screen. Isn't that a notion??? The camera is not the best in the world even though it is a name brand camera, but for goodness sakes it is a phone - who cares. I have also read the reviews that say the phone is ""locked"" to AT&T and this is not true. Yes it says AT&T on it but it works on any GSM network. Not too mention, I put it on AT&T's Go Phone prepaid plan so I am getting 4G LTE unlimited talk and text for $60 per month, and they sell the prepaid cards at a million stores and gas stations and you can setup your account online and AT&T even takes e-checks. I am done with the empty Android promises, locking phones, freezing screens, and inferior battery life that the Boost and Virgin Mobile phones provide. I don't even have to charge the phone every day and I talk over 5000 minutes per month. I will admit there are some apps like Mapquest and Google Maps that I miss from my android phone and AT&T charges for their navigation service. I will also admit the screen is no where near as brilliant as an I Phone or Galaxy or even the upper end Nokia. But I will gladly trade that for a phone that works everywhere and that does not freeze every five minutes. And I have invested $200 in the phone and I am paying $720 a year for 4G service on a great network and I don't have a contract and I can still sell this phone on Amazon a year from now for $100 or $150. Compare that with spending $500 or more and having a contract and spending $100 per month for unlimited. There is no comparison. I do regret I could not afford the Lumia 928 but for what I am getting I am grateful.",1

Though I knew the phone was unlocked, I had no clue it took a micros sim card, which I was not aware of and meant I had to go to a carrier and switch my sim card. Problem was solved in no time. Anyway back to this review. I was contemplating an Iphone purchase but I could not stand to spend upwards of 450 plus buckaroos on a phone. This cost me under 300 bucks give or take plus a few quality accessories. SO in the budget department alone, this phone gets a gold star. I have read reviews there is a lack of apps....I dispute that HOWEVER, do not expect an array of exactly what you see on android play store. There are a lot of apps for everything you need, some just not as popular. There are financial apps(Citibank, capitalone etc)missing but thats about it. With that in mind, the internet explorer is really smooth(way better than my old phone, my touch 4g slide). It has microsoft word and excel also. The interface is smooth, unbelievable this is a cool phone! One feature that is really different, the GPS navigator. Setting things up did not take long at all. You will be seduced by the sleek look. I am not done playing around with it, but i know now I made a good choice here. I dont know where Nokia has been(I had one in the early 2000s) but I have since had a blackberry and a couple of tmobile high end phones. Nokia has made a giant leap. 4/27/13 After a few more days of use I feel real proud about not caving to buy the iphone. The battery life, which with mytouch 4g was ALWAYS an issue, is really impressive. You get at least a good 10 hours if you leave it on,probably longer if you leave the battery saver option on. I discovered the sky drive(similar to icloud) on Marketplace which gives you additional 7Gigs or so free, plus available upgrades for a fee and you get to store for music or other files. I really do think the only thing that will stop this phone from blowing out the competition unfortunately, are the lack of the 'mainstream' apps. Also some apps free on Google play store(android) might not be on Marketplace(if available) But believe me unless you are one for the bandwagon, this change is worth a try, especially if the iphone or high end androids are a little above your budget.",9

B00836Y6B2,Eric Chaffee,5,"September 16, 2013",TRUE,iCloud users BEWARE,"I've logged four trips and more than six hours at the ATT store trying to get my new Windows phone to be able to receive email from my Apple iCloud account. I thought it must be me simply being dense. And nobody at the store knew that it couldn't be done. But that's the case! My bad. I bought a Windows phone made by Nokia: the Lumia 900. Really ELEGANT. Very affordable. Sweet, except I can't read my email thru Apple on this device. It's like asking somebody for directions and being told ""you can't get there from here."" Seriously, in this modern era, for three computer giants (Microsoft, Nokia, Apple) and a major communications company (ATT) to sell phone/service which can't (won't!) receive email from a competitor is dumbfounding. There oughta be a law! After being told the situation by the very patient, intelligent, lovely people who persistently tried to help me at the store, I came home and called ATT just to verify that this disconnect was fact. The kind lady in phone support put me on hold and soon came back to tell me that, indeed, this was a definitive finding. And it holds for the 920, 925 and 1020 models, as well. Further research would seem to suggest that Apple is the fly in the ointment. So I've hit upon a solution. I will become my own email host. As I already own a domain name for my WordPress blog, thru Godaddy, I will begin using it as my primary email account, phasing out Apple. Hey, buying a Windows phone was a step away from being monopolized, and now Apple has pushed me one more down the path. NB: I revised this review from one star to five after some deep reflection, pain, and clarity. I had bailed on gmail a year and a half ago; and now I'm bailing on iCloud. Don't do evil. And don't be a chump.",2
B00836Y6B2,nef,4,"February 23, 2013",TRUE,Works fine,"I chose 1 day shipping and it did actually come the next day, so it shipped fast. First, I do not think it is new because it was not in original packaging. It was in a Lumia 900 box, but the phone was not secure in it, just kind of banging around inside. It did not come with headphones, and the manual looked photocopied, so that was not original either. So if you think you will get something like if you bought it at the store, you won't. Anyway, I've been using the phone for about 2 weeks now, and it seems to be fine. It actually is unlocked. I am using it with Straight Talk. The description is wrong in that it does NOT have a microSD slot. It has 16GB internal memory ONLY. There is no slot for a microSD. The phone itself is working fine though, and I am happy with it. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but I really wanted a Lumia 900 so I took the chance. So far, so good. My seller was DealInABox, I think it was. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because it did not come with headphones and it seems to be used or refurbished and it had already been unboxed, as indicated by the phone just banging around inside the box and not being secure, as well as the photocopied manual, and missing headphones. I would rather have had a new one like the description said, but for only 300 dollars AND unlocked, I won't complain too much about it. So far, I am happy with my purchase.",3

B00836Y6B2,Ken Martin,3,"May 7, 2013",TRUE,Not What I Thought,This was going to be a gift for an older relative. I read the manual before purchasing this phone. I have been a Nokia fan for many years and I was upgrading a phone for a older relative. The instructions said it was easy to transfer data from a Nokia OVI format to this windows format. Three hours on the phone with Nokia Support and many issue later it is not easy to transfer previous data with out a lot of programing. Also the Zune Software for pictures and music does not perform like the OVI. I guess it would have been better if I had started from scratch and not had such a very good previous experience. I would not recommend it as an upgrade. My relative will just stick with their previous Nokia product. I plan on returning the phone.,1

I began to use this phone just over a month ago and several times the phone just freeze up and power off like it has a mind of its own. Today, for more than two minutes, I could not tell what was happening, the screen was black it would not turn on even though I did not turn it off. Then it powered back on all by itself. I bought this phone unlocked so I could use it without a contract. I think it is still connected to AT&T because the carrier I am with is unable to unlock the section where I can get picture text. I would not buy another one since AT&T seems to have a monopoly on them. I was wondering if I can go into their store so they can tell me how to unlock the picture text part of it. I believe it would be better to buy a phone that is not connected to any carrier and there would be no problem. I get drop calls in places where people with the same carrier doesn't them so I have to blame the phone. Because of all the problems I have with this phone, I would not recommend it to anyone unless I just happen to get one with a fault.

B00836Y6B2,The Doctor,3,"January 20, 2017",FALSE,A very reliable phone but it's setbacks are many.,"Okay so I'm not going to lie I have never been the biggest fan of Windows products however I had heard some good reviews on the phones so I opted to get one. The truth is I actually switched back to android after getting this phone because it does have a good amount of issues. Now don't get me wrong I got some good use out of this phone and I didn't despise it however I wasn't the biggest fan of it either. So before i get into the bad i'm going to mention the good because I feel good news should come before bad. So the first great thing about this phone is how sleek and nice looking it is. This is a sexy looking phone and it feel nice in the hand when surfing the web, texting, and calling; it's a nice phone to handle. It's also pretty reliable, I won't lie I drop my phones sometimes (who doesn't? if you say you don't you're a liar) and this phone has never cracked a screen or stopped working, worst thing that's happened is the case gets scuffed. Call quality is crystal clear and it's never dropped a call not even when I've been out hiking, the call quality on this phone is fantastic. The phone's LCD screen is also immensely beautiful and images and videos are in perfect HD resolution, the speaker is also surprisingly loud even though it's pretty small. Now this phone earned the nickname ""The Stormtrooper"" for being immensely tough and resilient against breakage, however I feel much like Stormtroopers it misses it's shots on a lot and I mean a lot of points which gives me pause on ever buying one again. The first big issue isn't even a functionality problem more of a Windows problem. If you're an app person just walk away because Windows doesn't even have a quarter of the apps that Apple and Android have, in fact the amount of apps that this phone supports is almost comically small and laughable. The only two real social media platforms that this phone supports is Facebook and Twitter, Instagram is nonexistent (they offer a beta version but some phones don't support it and it's pretty broken) and snapchat is off the radar. As an alternative some users have created ""portal"" type versions of these apps that allow you to sort of connect to the social media platform you want however they are not very user friendly. The second biggest issue is the battery life on this phone, so while it boasts a whopping 7 hours of calling that is only true if that's all you do on this phone. If you surf the web, text, call, use Facebook, etc. You will be lucky to get 5 hours out of the phone before the battery saver function cuts your fun short and gives you a 30% battery life warning. The biggest problem with the battery isn't even the life span but the fact that it is an integrated part of the phone that cannot be accessed. The battery is a permanent part of the phone's internal working and cannot be switched out at all, one thing I like about other phones is the option to change your battery out because the batteries are removable however that isn't an option here since the battery pack cannot be removed. The third issue is that this phone does NOT support micro SD cards AT ALL nor can it be made to. This phone actually has an internal storage with no option for external storage so unless you upload your photos to Window's version of the Cloud (which is 100% permanent and cannot be taken down i might add so beware what you post) you will lose all of your vacation pictures and selfies if your phone were to ever gonk out. I got about a good year of use out my Lumia 900 before the phone finally gonked but I personally believe that there are better options for phones out there. All in all I didn't hate my Lumia but I probably will never purchase this phone again given the amount of setbacks it has. Now don't take my word for it try the phone yourself and for all you know you may love it. For me personally however I was not a fan of this phone.",
B00836Y6B2,Becca,5,"December 4, 2012",FALSE,Great Phone!,"The Nokia Lumia 900 was my first smartphone. Im a programmer, so I really appreciate how easy it is to write software for it. That being said, the phoen itself is what I'm rating so lets get to it. The Good: I love the feature-rich experience and the battery life is quite good. Despite what I have read from other websites it seems fairly light to me (then again, I don't like owning a smartphone that feels like its gonna float away). The speaker is one of the loudest I have ever heard on a smartphone, and it outputs really good quality audio too! The camera takes excelent quality photos and I feel that it is quite feature-rich. The flash is extremely bright, and makes a good flashlight in a pinch. the case is so tough that I dare someone to try and break it. I have yet to scratch the phone case itself and I have had this phone for about 6 months now (I tend to drop my phone, so this is impressive). The Bad: Let me first say that I DO NOT have a problem with the hardware. I have a few compaints about the software though. If you know about WP already then the rest of this section won't help you. That being said, I would dearly like to be able to make playlists on the go without the need to sync with zune software. I will also be excited when more developers get apps into the store (although all the ones I need are already there). My biggest issue right now is the OS upgrade, or rather the lack of one. WP8 came out and lumia 900 users kinda got the shaft. Bottom Line: This phone is an excelent choice! The price is excelent, the calls are clear, the interface is sleek, and the phone is near indestructable. I would like to see some love from microsoft in regaurds to software upgrades, but other than that I would (and do) recomend this phone to anyone who wants a good, dependable phone.",27
B00836Y6B2,Burkay,1,"May 21, 2013",FALSE,Smart Phone with Issues,"UPDATE: MMS function is broken. The phone can neither receive nor send images and videos via text. I've tried troubleshooting it using every trick I could find on the internet including the official forums of Microsoft, Nokia and my career, with no result other than wasting almost an entire morning. And I am very tech-savvy (seriously, I've hacked all my kindles so far. I use Linux. If I can't solve the problem, not many can.) I deduct 2 stars from my 3-star review because this is kind of a big deal for most users. Come on MS and Nokia, how do you expect to survive against Apple and Android with a problem like this? UPDATE: Zune constantly causes trouble. Every time I need to connect my phone to my Win 7 pro pc, I need to troubleshoot manually from the device manager to get the PC recognize the phone. If this happened in 2004, I would understand. Back then, our standards of plug-n-play were much lower. Now, they are high and especially because THIS IS A WINDOWS PHONE CONNECTING TO A WINDOWS PC. How would the people who buy iphones feel if they connect it to their macbooks and it fails to even recognize the device? Dumb right? So, I take a star off. Still good phone for the price, but if you can afford a good android, go for it I say. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this phone new on another website (woot.com, affiliate of amazon) for 199.99, it was a great bargain for the price. I would consider buying at Amazon.com's price too. Pros: 1- Very responsive touchscreen. I can't tell the difference between the latest iphone and Lumia 900 in this regard. 2- Light. 3- Sleek look. 4- Unlocked. (T-mobile doesn't list 900 on their compatible phones list but everything works including 4g) 5- Great price. Cons: 1- Zune. To connect it to a computer you have to install Zune. Windows 7 doesn't even recognize the phone without Zune (which is ironic, because it is after all a windows phone), I don't like producers shoving down clinger-ware down my throat just because they can. The device has 16 GB memory (12 available after OS and updates). So, why the hell not install the communication protocol on it and don't make me use Zune as interface. 2- The landscape mode is a bit glitchy. It keeps going back to the portrait mode when you enter a new contact to your phone book. You have to turn and twist it a bit to get it back to landscape. 3- Not as many apps. Most app developers consider windows platform a dead-duck. So, if you want to use the newest apps, stick to apple or android. In-betweens: 1- Camera. It works well for a phone camera but nothing to write home about. 2- Sound quality. Works well. Again nothing special. The speakers can get very loud, do you really want to use your phone speakers to listen to music? Verdict: Solid smart phone for the price. It is near unjustifiable to pay triple for the newest Iphone or Android machine unless you are crazy about the apps.",9
B00836Y6B2,D. Lawson,1,"August 25, 2013",FALSE,"Easy to use, limited apps, LOUSY Camera! Avoid Nokia","I bought the Lumia 900 on AT&T when it first came out. Likes: Operating system. It's easy to use and responsive. Battery life. Goes on and on. Screen. It's bright and big. Dislikes: Operating system. This phone has the old Windows phone 7 or 7.5. Apps. There are not a whole lot out there. And there are few if any new ones. Whenever I go to the 'Store,' I see the same old dog apps that have been there for the last 1 1/2 years. Camera. The camera initially worked well, but the lens has become cloudy - and I've taken good care of this phone. As a result it is unusable. Not only are pictures and videos no longer possible, but the phone's scan capability has been rendered useless. I can no longer scan bar codes for price checks. I'm stuck with this thing for another 7 months till my 2 year contract is up. What a disappointment! Not so much Microsoft's phone system, but Nokia's product quality.",1
B00836Y6B2,EightInTheNest,3,"December 2, 2012",FALSE,Not impressed with the camera!,"I was a devoted Blackberry user for the last 5 years. When the Windows phone came out I was interested, and when I won one I was thrilled! Now that I've had the chance to play with and use the Nokia 900 here are my thoughts. First, wow. This is supposed to be THE camera for those who want great pictures. YEAH RIGHT. Nearly all of my pictures turn out blurry, and if I zoom in...OH.MY.GOSH. They are truly terrible. Pixelated and just horrid. This is most definitely NOT what I expected from this phone's camera! Another huge downfall for me is the inability to choose which album my photos go to when I share them to Facebook. This is a developer issue, I believe, not necessarily the phone's issue (but maybe it is?), but it is a BIG deal to me. I don't want photos to just go to my ""mobile uploads"". I miss my speed-dial option. I used to have a set key to call my house and my husband's cell phone, I am unable to do this with the 900. :( I also found it too easy to change the sound for the ringtone and in-call while in your pocket (or purse) or while you are actually talking/using the phone. Another thing I dislike is the ability to change the calendar view permanently. I prefer month view, but you cannot get month view to stay on your calendar settings, only daily view and then you have to touch to see the month view. A minor annoyance, but still very cumbersome to me. The battery life is unimpressive. With minor use I go through my battery in less than 10 hours. I need a battery that lasts longer. Even with the battery saver turning on it doesn't do enough. Also, if you prefer to have a light background vs the dark background you will go through your battery even faster. Have a car charger available! Another HUGE thing is the inability to select text. I often want to copy text that is in an email and I am unable to do this with the Lumia 900. Huge disappointment and another reason I miss Blackberry. :/ Things I do like... I like the Windows OS. I like the Windows 8 OS better than this 7.5 Mango, but it's not all that bad. I like the ability to have multiple alarms. I like the screen, it's large and beautiful. The touch screen is pretty accurate, and I was able to transfer from the actual qwerty keyboard to the virtual one fairly easily ( I was very tentative of this). The apps that are available are great, there are plenty of free apps that are great to have. I love that I can watch Netflix on this device! I am looking forward to trying the 920 and I am hoping some of these issues have been resolved...but for the Lumia 900 all I can say is it's ""okay"".",1
B00836Y6B2,Adam S.,5,"December 28, 2012",FALSE,Nokia is still one of the best.,"I have had this phone for several weeks now and it is absolutely a great phone. Very nice upgrade from the iPhone. It is not an Apple phone and having said that, I am glad it is not. iPhone and Apple as a whole have moved us into this grove that we have forgotten the true potential of smart phones. That being said, Nokia has always made the most durable and reliable phones and this phone is nothing short of amazing. I would however support a move away from Microsoft software on the phone and going back to Nokia software. It worked flawlessly back then and I would expect nothing less if they moved back to their roots of doing mobiles the way they should have always been done. All in all, you cannot go wrong with this phone !",

Another awesome feature is Skydrive and Microsoft Office are all synced. It is light and relatively thin. This phone has convinced many iPhone users to switch, and not regret that switch. If you are a gamer, this phone comes with Xbox Live integrated into many of the apps to add up gaming achievements and Xbox points.

I've been unable to get it to turn back on. The folks at AT&T were also unable to help me turn it back on, so they're mailing me a new one. But if I could have my way, I would trade it in for an Android. The camera on this thing is excellent, no doubt about that, but most apps are developed only for Android or iPhone. I can't get many of my favorite apps on this, so it definitely left me wanting. Games that were free on my Samsung cost $1.99 on a Nokia. AND THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE THE BATTERY ON THIS THING. I want everyone to be aware of that. Though I hear that most of the newer phones are heading in that direction. Manufacturers are starting to get greedy. Now when the battery dies, we can't just go out and buy a new battery. The entire phone will have to be replaced. It's big and clumsy. I miss my Samsung. The call clarity is great, the OS is good, and it links up very well with hotmail (all of my camera pics were on my SkyDrive, even though I didn't put them there).

Anyway, I contact the seller and explained the situation. They were very understanding and accommodating. I was immediately sent a prepaid shipping label and got a refund within a few days. The refund was for the purchase price and shipping. Since the return label was prepaid, the whole ordeal only cost me time and for that I blame my service provider.

So I arrived without a functional phone to call my ride... not so good, but I connected it to a charger--the charge took, and I was able to call.

Basically it's a tiny notification light that flashes on the top left of the face of the phone. It changes color based on if you have a message/what type of message it is. I find this handy because you can tell if you have a new message without turning on the screen.

I haven't encountered any lag as of yet running any app. The 8GB of internal RAM doesn't seem to be an issue for me. I don't have a ton of stuff to put on the phone, and even if I did I have a 32GB SD card for media, so 8GB is plenty of internal storage. The battery life in this thing is phenomenal. I haven't felt a pressing need to charge the phone at all yet because it survives all day until bed time with ample power left every day. I plug my phone in every night as a matter of habit from my old phones. I don't think this phone needs it though. I leave 4G data on all day. I also have rules setup to enable WiFi when I'm home. The rules are especially nice and handy for controlling the phone without actively having to change settings, which is something I had to often on my Droid Charge. I especially appreciate the smaller form factor of this phone. My Charge had a 4.3"" screen, as does this phone, but the Charge feels like a brick now compared to the Razr M. I specifically didn't get the HD version because I don't want a ridiculously large screen. I don't need it. I don't plan on watching movies on my phone. I've taken some pictures and am quite satisified with the camera for my average uses. The shutter is unbelievably quick compared to the Charge. I was especially surprised by the quality of an image taken under full zoom. I love the aluminum frame and the kevlar back plate. The mirror on the back is a nice touch too so I can take vanity shots with a higher quality lens, though I don't really intend on doing so too often. I generally hate pictures of myself. Overall I am very satisfied with this phone. I'm an average user, though I do want to root this phone. I don't see a need for a custom ROM though because the stock ROM has been quite nice so far.",1
B0096QYH80,Montana Matthews,1,"August 31, 2015",TRUE,I would not recommend the refurbished product to other buyers,"I bought the refurbished phone. Item came quickly, with charger and phone intact. It worked well for a week or so but when I ran it out of battery it had trouble turning back on. After letting it sit for ten minutes I tried again and had no problems. The next time I let the battery run out, I placed the phone on its charger and let it charge. I was not able to turn it on again. I have tried everything, nothing on the phone is working. I will be attempting to return this product. Previous reviews have said this happened to them. I would not recommend the refurbished product to other buyers.",

B0096QYH80,CASSANDRA POOLE,5,"March 5, 2015",TRUE,Retraction for first Comments,"I want to retract my other comment in which I question if my phone was really new..... Well the reason I said that was because the back looked faded, well the faded appearance was due to the plastic film that was on the back of the phone. Once that was removed, it had a nice unscratched back. Please excuse me for thinking that it may not have been a new phone.",

B0096QYH80,Michael L. Stanton,4,"August 18, 2015",TRUE,Smart phone fits my hand and doesn't fall out of my shirt pocket.,I traded a pocket protector for the Droid RAZR M three years ago. This purchase is a replacement following the unexpected demise of my RAZR M. The screen is easy to read; the speaker is just right for my occasional listening. The sound is better than the shirt pocket transistor radios I owned in the '60s. The phone itself works better than the company issued Nokia and Blackberry.,

Worked pretty good for the first month or so... But then started freezing and saying, for example, contacts unexpectedly stopped. Not something that should happen with a new phone.

Product arrived on time and it was exactly as described. It came in Veriyon box with a travel charger, instruction manual and an online service voucher. We did have problems with finding a matching sim ( micro sim) card in our local stores so we ended up waiting for over a week to get one from verison. The phone mostly works very well. It did not want to charge a few times and once we couldn't shut down the alarmclock off, but those are issues I would bring to the manufacturer. All in all seller was great and deserves 5 stars but phone itself would be somwhere beetween 3 and 4 stars.",1
